### Tools Used :

-   Visual Studio Code
-   DBeaver
-   Git & Gitahead
-   Composer
-   Laravel & PHP
-   Tailwind.css
-   Gmail & Mailtrap
-   Node & NPM

### To Setup :

-   `npm install`
-   `composer install`
-   `npm run dev`

---

### Personal Notes :

-   after installed any plugin, you need to do `npm i` to synchronize between `package.json` & `composer.json`
-   after changed `webpack.mix.js`, since laravel mix is webpack based, youâ€™ll need to compile those files with `npm run dev`.
-   while you're on development please run `php artisan serve` & `npm run watch`. 1 so you can visit localhost, the other 1 so you don't need to run `npm run dev` for every scss file change you made
-   its good to have layout in laravel where you can put your link rel in <head> for just 1 time rather than put in all your component
-   can refer to our personal ms.word notes at drive when you want to regain knowledge after a while - P.S we dont have password in our local mysql
-   for email setup, here are some examples :

##### For Mailtrap (local/testing level)

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=30205bc21626b8
MAIL_PASSWORD=e211bdfef34f72
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=frederick@fdpalette.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

MAIL_USERNAME="YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
MAIL_PASSWORD="YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD"
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="PREFERED_SENDER_EMAIL"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
